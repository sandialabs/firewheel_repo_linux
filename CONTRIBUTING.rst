As a tool within the FIREWHEEL ecosystem, the FIREWHEEL developers apply the same contribution guidelines and expectations to this model component (MC) as the FIREWHEEL package.
Those guidelines are detailed completely in the `root FIREWHEEL repository <https://github.com/sandialabs/firewheel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
